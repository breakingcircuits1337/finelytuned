## Phase 1: Plan application architecture and features
- [ ] Define overall architecture (frontend, backend, ML model interaction)
- [ ] Choose specific technologies (Flask for backend, React for frontend, Hugging Face/PyTorch for ML)
- [ ] Outline core features (data upload, CPU/GPU selection, training initiation, progress bar, time estimation, system prompt/pasted text option)
- [ ] Consider data storage and model saving mechanisms

## Phase 2: Set up Flask backend with ML training capabilities
- [x] Created Flask app using manus-create-flask-app utility
- [x] Installed ML dependencies (torch, transformers, datasets, accelerate)
- [x] Created training routes (/upload, /estimate, /start, /progress, /stop, /models)
- [x] Implemented TrainingService with fine-tuning logic
- [x] Added CORS support for frontend-backend communication
- [x] Updated requirements.txt with all dependencies
## Phase 3: Create React frontend with file upload and training interface
- [x] Created React app using manus-create-react-app utility
- [x] Updated title to "Slow Go Mofo - AI Fine-tuning"
- [x] Built comprehensive UI with file upload, model selection, device selection
- [x] Implemented training configuration (epochs, learning rate, batch size)
- [x] Added support for three training modes: file upload, system prompt, pasted text
- [x] Created progress tracking interface with real-time updates
- [x] Built the React app and copied to Flask static directory
## Phase 4: Implement training progress tracking and time estimation
- [x] Progress tracking already implemented in TrainingService with real-time updates
- [x] Time estimation based on dataset size, device type, and model complexity
- [x] Fixed missing import in training service
- [x] Created sample test file for testing
- [x] Progress includes: status, percentage, current epoch, loss, time remaining
- [x] Frontend polls progress every 2 seconds during training
## Phase 5: Test the application locally and fix any issues
- [x] Started Flask server successfully on port 5001
- [x] Verified application loads correctly with beautiful UI design
- [x] Tested all three training modes: Upload File, System Prompt, Paste Text
- [x] Confirmed system prompt input functionality works
- [x] Verified training starts successfully with progress tracking
- [x] Confirmed progress bar, status updates, and real-time monitoring work
- [x] Tested Stop button functionality
- [x] All core features working as expected
## Phase 6: Deploy the application and deliver to user



### Architecture Details:
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- ML Framework: PyTorch
- LLM Fine-tuning: Hugging Face Transformers
- Data Storage: File-based for datasets



### Core Features:
- Data Upload: Allow users to upload text datasets (e.g., .txt, .csv, .jsonl).
- LLM Selection: Provide options for pre-trained LLMs (e.g., smaller GPT-2, DistilBERT).
- Device Selection: Option to choose between CPU and GPU for training.
- Training Initiation: Button to start the fine-tuning process.
- Progress Bar: Real-time progress updates during training.
- Time Estimation: Estimate training time based on dataset size and selected device before training starts.
- System Prompt/Pasted Text: Option to fine-tune with a single system prompt or pasted text instead of a dataset.
- Model Saving: Save the fine-tuned model.
- Application Name: "Slow Go Mofo"
