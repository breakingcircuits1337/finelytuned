This is a sample training text for testing the AI fine-tuning application.
The model will learn from this text and similar examples.
Fine-tuning allows us to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks.
This process can take time, especially on CPU, but it's worth the wait.
Slow and steady wins the race in machine learning.
Quality data is more important than quantity.
The "Slow Go Mofo" application makes fine-tuning accessible to everyone.
Even small datasets can produce meaningful results with proper training.
Patience is a virtue when training neural networks.
Every epoch brings us closer to a better model.
